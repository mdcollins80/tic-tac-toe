Tic-Tac-Toe Project!!

This labor of love was made possible by Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

I created a custom game engine to handle the game play.  An empty game array is created, and on clicking on the gameboard, a click counter is used to determine whose turn it is based on odd or even click counters (odd is x's turn, even is o's)  The game array is updated based on the id of the gameboard div that was clicked.  This info is also used to update the api for that game.

A landing page enables the user to sign up and/or sign in.

User can change their password on signing in.  User can play a new game, call up a previous game, and/or sign out.  If recalling, if the previous game was unfinished, the user can complete the game from where he/she left off.

Please enjoy!

Improvements:
Retrieve a list of game ids on demand for use with the Get Game feature.
Improve UI.  Smaller menu items for more conducive mobile experience.
Highlight winning combo.
